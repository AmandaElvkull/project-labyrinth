# Project Labyrinth

This was a group project done during week 12 of Technigo's Boot Camp by Kaja Wilbik, Amanda Elvkull and Ulrika Ã–hman. It was about building a Labyrinth game that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

## The problem

We started off with mob programming, creating a reducer for the game. After that two functions were made for fetching two different API's. For each 'room' of the game (each room connected to a coordinate retrieved from the API) we made the descriptions and possible directions to go to show. We also passed the background images as props so it would change according to the current coordinate. Lastly we styled everything with styled components.
